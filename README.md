==============

What kind of development server does this project use to server HTML pages?

> live-server, because it refreshes the page mautomatically when the code changes.

Why do we use Grunt?

> to compile LESS to CSS, to compile JSX (React files) to JS, to concatenate source files.

Why do we use Bower?

> To easily manage/update client-side dependencies like D3, React, Bootstrap, etc.
